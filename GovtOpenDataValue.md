## Challenges in Government Data

_These are some follow-on thoughts to a session titled "Getting Value out of Government Data", with perspectives from a data wrangler who's now a recently minted  govie coming in from the private sector_

### This is not a full recap of everything discussed, but does highlight some items of particular interest to me relating to government data transparency and usability:

- Josh Hurd [@nonprofmetrics](http://twitter.com/nonprofmetrics) gave a presentation on mining government data for use in analysis of non-profits and discussed some of the challenges of using the data, for example that IRS provides scanned TIFF image, which need to be processed into being machine-readable, and which then still contain many errors and other data quality problems.  They actually have been looking at committing a full time hire just to deal with the data quality issues

- Hudson Hollister [@hudsonhollister](http://twitter.com/hudsonhollister) gave a presentation on data transparency and hit the nail on its head in citing an example from his own experience at SEC of a very document and process focused culture in government, as opposed to an information and business process focused culture.

- Aneet Makin [@legcyte](http://twitter.com/legcyte) discussed opening up legislative data via [LegCyte](http://www.legcyte.com/), along with being able to recognize language from prior bills and track the originating legislator.

- Tom Lee [@sunlightlabs](http://twitter.com/sunlightlabs) made a great case for the value of government data and gave several examples, i.e. MapBox, Zonability, and Brightscope, where it falls in the category of "public good" - and of the business case of dealing with government data that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable.  However, he likewise reiterated the data quality problem
