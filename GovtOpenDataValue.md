## Challenges in Government Data

_These are some follow-on thoughts to a session titled "Getting Value out of Government Data", with perspectives from a data wrangler who's now a recently minted  govie coming in from the private sector_

### Some recap on items in the session talks that caught my attention:

- [@nonprofmetrics](http://twitter.com/nonprofmetrics) gave a presentation on mining government data for use in analysis of non-profits and discussed some of the challenges of using the data, for example that IRS provides scanned TIFF image, which need to be processed into being machine-readable, and which then still contain many errors and other data quality problems.  They actually have been looking at committing a full time hire just to deal with the data quality issues.
- [@hudsonhollister](http://twitter.com/hudsonhollister) gave a presentation on open data and cited an example from SEC of a very document and process focused culture in government, as opposed to an information and business process focused culture.  He hits the nail on the head with this.
